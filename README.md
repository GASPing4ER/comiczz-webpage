## Requirements Not Implemented:

- All requirements were implemented.

## Issues Faced During Implementation:

**Server Side API Fetching**: I initially wanted to fetch Marvel comics through server side rendering, but due to marvel's website crashing when authenticating me, I couldn't get a private key. I implemented serverFetching function anyway to simulate how I would sign via SSR.

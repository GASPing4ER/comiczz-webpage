## Requirements Not Implemented:

- All requirements were implemented.

## Issues Faced During Implementation:

**Server Side API Fetching**: I initially wanted to fetch Marvel comics through server side rendering, but due to marvel's website crashing when authenticating me, I couldn't get a private key. I implemented serverFetching function anyway to simulate how I would sign via SSR.

## Install:

- Clone this repository.
- In terminal run npm install
- Afterwards run npm run dev
- Keep in mind that you need .env and inside it NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PUBLIC_KEY from Marvel
